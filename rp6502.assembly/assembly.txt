This is a board of sockets and connectors. No active components.
Everything is thru-hole. PCB is optimized for hand assembly.
The attached photo.jpg shows a fully assembled board.
There is a video of me assembling this on YouTube:

The four corner holes are for mounting and must be masked for wave soldering.

U2 and U4 are header sockets for a special IC, the Raspberry Pi Pico.
The dual 1x20 header sockets must be perpendicular to the board.
U2 has two additional 1x3 sockets the must be perpendicular to the board.
Alignment "by eye" is good enough if the assembler is careful.

All parts are available from multiple vendors. Feel free to suggest cheaper
or more available options. Capacitor tolerance and temp type does not matter
if voltage is >= 10V. Resistors may be any wattage but must be <= 1%.
J1 and J2 must be gold. U1-U8 may be tin.

The silkscreen on the back of the board has component values that I use for
manual assembly and testing. You may depend on this if you choose to use it.
With a multimeter set to ohms, test each passive from the back of the board:
 - All capacitors must test as > 50 ohm - not shorted.
 - All resistors must test as the value silkscreened.
