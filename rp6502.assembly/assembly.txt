This is a board of sockets and connectors. No active components.
See photo.jpg for a fully assembled board.

The four corner holes are for mounting and must be masked for wave soldering.

U2 and U4 are sockets made from multiple parts. Care must be taken to keep
the sockets perpendicular to the board. Alignment "by eye" is good enough.

All parts may be substituted. VGA connector must be blue or black. Audio
connector must be green or black. Capacitor tolerance and temp type does not
matter if voltage is >= 10V. Resistors may be any wattage but must be <= 1%.
J1 and J2 must be gold. U1-U8 may be tin.

The silkscreen on the back of the board may be used for testing.
With a multimeter set to ohms, test each passive from the back of the board:
 - All capacitors must test as > 50 ohm - not shorted.
 - All resistors must test as the value silkscreened.
